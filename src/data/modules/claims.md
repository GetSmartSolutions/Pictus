The PICTUS Claims module is designed for adjudication and approval of claims. It will allow organizations to configure mandated products and prices, tally up the total rebate due and trigger payment to the claimant.

PICTUS Claims is being built to integrate with other key elements in the claims lifecycle. Specifically:

Integration with financial systems that manage accounts payable. PICTUS Claims will pass an approved bill to accounts payable for payment by the “back end” of the claims process.

PICTUS Claims coordinates the submission of detailed manifest information (through an automated interface where detailed information is available to the agency), providing summarized information for adjudication and approval by the agency.

A flexible rules engine allows for complicated approval rules to be configured by the agency. Even multi-agency configurations are possible, including pay on collected and pay on processed situations.
