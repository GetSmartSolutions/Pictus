The PICTUS Claims module is designed for adjudication and approval of claims. It will allow organizations to configure mandated products and prices, tally up the total rebate due and trigger payment to the claimant.

PICTUS Claims coordinates the submission of detailed manifest information (through an automated interface where detailed information is available to the agency), providing summarized information for adjudication and approval by the agency.
