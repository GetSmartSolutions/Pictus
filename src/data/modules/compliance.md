PICTUS Compliance will provide further support for identifying compliance risk situations and tracking follow up and audit. It will use the Registration applicationâ€™s communication features to ensure compliance activities are logged and communicated (where necessary) to members. Support for compliance filing and invoicing is already built into the Filing module.
