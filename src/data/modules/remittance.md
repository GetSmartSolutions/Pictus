The Remittance module allows members to see the full life cycle of invoices, through to a fully paid invoice.

PICTUS Filing creates the invoice. PICTUS Remittance adds balance outstanding information, allowing payments to be applied on invoices. Optionally, online payment methods can be connected for immediate payment. Interfaces to standard accounting systems allow for the seamless transfer of invoices to Financial accounts receivable systems, and the return of matched invoice payments back into PICTUS. The result is the member is able to understand what has been paid and what remains outstanding. Historical invoices with associated payment details are available to the member for viewing and downloading.
