The Filing module allows members to file information in a simple, intuitive way, similar to an online store. The filing is typically linked to the collection of agency fees based on the sale of a product.

Using PICTUS Filing, member filings are created automatically based on a periodic filing cycle (e.g. monthly, quarterly, yearly) and status (e.g. active). PICTUS Filing provides a clean, simple interface where members can submit and approve filings. An invoice is produced on approval, which the member can view and download.

The product catalogue is multi-level and includes effective-dated pricing. Additional charges such as tax, commissions, and penalties can be set up.
