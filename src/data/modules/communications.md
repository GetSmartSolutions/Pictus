Communications is one of our favourite and perhaps unexpected modules. It allows the agencies to send, manage, and monitor mass and one on one communications between itself and the members. Keep track of who is receiving and reading the e-mails you send out. Use a wide array of custom searches that allow the agencies to contact members based on absolutely any range of criteria. That sounds impressive, but believe us, we can do it.
