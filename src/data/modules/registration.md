Registration is at the core of PICTUS as it holds the structure of organizations, members, addresses, contacts, notes, and users. The registration module is designed to be used both from the point of view of the agency managing the program as well as it's members. Members have the option of self registering and depending on the agencies capacity more of that responsibility can be given to the members or controlled by the agency.
