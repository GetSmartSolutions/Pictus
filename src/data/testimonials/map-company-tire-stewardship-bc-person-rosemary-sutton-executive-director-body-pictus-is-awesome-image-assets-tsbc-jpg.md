Tire Stewardship BC is a happy and satisfied PICTUS client. We have over 2,000 retailers using PICTUS monthly for Revenue filings and our feedback from them has been overwhelmingly positive. The move to PICTUS from a paper and cheque approach has resulted in administration and compliance efficiencies for both TSBC and its retailers.  A significant benefit for both parties is the ability to have quick and ready access to current, outstanding and paid filings.
