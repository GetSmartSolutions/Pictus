  and the price is reflected in those decisions.

PICTUS operates "in the cloud" as a subscription service. This means you have zero requirements for IT. You subscribe to only the modules you need. You can expand your service at any time and end your service as well.

The system is highly configurable, which means you have many options to define your business processes.
