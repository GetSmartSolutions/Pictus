  and the price is reflected in those decisions.

PICTUS operates "in the cloud" as a subscription service. This means you have zero requirements for IT. You subscribe to only the modules you need. 

The modules work together to create a complete integrated solution but are designed to work independently to meet your immediate needs. Add or subtract modules as your needs change. PICTUS Registration is a core component required for all modules

The system is highly configurable, which means you have many options to define your business processes.
