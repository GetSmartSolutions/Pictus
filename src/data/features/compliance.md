You collect recycling fees from your member businesses. Automatically create periodic filings and send out reminder e-mails. Businesses file simply and easily on the web and pay through their bank websites. Keep track of what businesses are filing and paying and when. 

PICTUS can be set up for a simple provincial PRO or nationally across multiple autonomous PROs, yet present a simple, intuitive way for businesses to file all in one place.
